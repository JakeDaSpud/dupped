A [1-Button Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024) Submission

dupped is a test of your timing, judgement, and hand-eye coordination, all with one button!

[Play the game in-browser here on itch.io!](https://jakeoreilly.itch.io/dupped) ⬅️

### ❔How to Play
- Hold your button for a couple seconds before the game starts to mute sound.
- Your button will flip gravity.
- You have to touch the centre ball in the capsules floating by to earn points.
 - The slow blue ones are worth less points.
 - The fast red ones are worth more points because they're harder to survive (you have to keep rapidly flipping between the top and bottom of the capsule!).
